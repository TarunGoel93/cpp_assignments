116. Problem Statement: Define a class Employee to represent employee details like
employee ID, name, and salary. Implement a member function to give a raise to the
employee&#39;s salary.
Objectives: To practice defining classes and implementing member functions for data
manipulation.
Functionalities: Give a raise to an employee&#39;s salary.

    private:

                salary += amount;

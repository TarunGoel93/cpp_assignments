118. Problem Statement: Implement a class Complex to represent complex numbers.
Include member functions to add, subtract, multiply, and divide two complex
numbers.
Objectives: To understand how to implement arithmetic operations for custom data
types.
Functionalities: Perform arithmetic operations on complex numbers.

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

class Complex{
    private:
    double x1,y1,x2,y2;
    public:
    void input(){
        cout<<"Enter the first number (x+yi): "<<endl;
        cout<<"Enter the first value (x): ";
        cin>>x1;
        cout<<"Enter the first value (y): ";
        cin>>y1;
        cout<<"Enter the second number (x+yi): "<<endl;
        cout<<"Enter the second value (x): ";
        cin>>x2;
        cout<<"Enter the second value (y): ";
        cin>>y2;
    }
   
    void output(){
        cout<<"Addition : "<<x1+x2<<"+"<<y1+y2<<"i"<<endl;
        cout<<"Subtraction : "<<x1-x2<<"+"<<y1-y2<<"i"<<endl;
        cout<<"Multiplication : "<<x1*x2<<"+"<<y1*y2<<"i"<<endl;
        cout<<"Division : "<<x1/x2<<"+"<<y1/y2<<"i"<<endl;
    }
};

int main()
{
    Complex c;
    c.input();
    c.output();
}

/*111. Problem Statement: Create a class called Rectangle to represent a rectangle.
Define member variables to store its length and width. Implement member functions
to calculate its area and perimeter.
Objectives: To practice defining classes, member variables, and member functions in
C++.
Functionalities: Calculate area and perimeter of a rectangle.*/

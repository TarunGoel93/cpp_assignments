112. Problem Statement: Implement a class Student to represent a students details
like name, roll number, and marks in three subjects. Provide member functions to
input and display student details, as well as calculate the average marks.
Objectives: To understand how to define classes with multiple member variables and
member functions.
Functionalities: Input student details, display details, calculate average marks.

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

class Student{
    private:
    string name;
    int rollNumber,marks1,marks2,marks3,result;
    public:
    
    Student(): name(""),rollNumber(0),marks1(0),marks2(0),marks3(0){}

    void input(){
        cout<<"Enter your name: ";
        cin>>name;
        cout<<"Enter your roll number: ";
        cin>>rollNumber;
        cout<<"Enter the marks of your three subjects: ";
        cin>>marks1>>marks2>>marks3;
    }
    void calculate(){
        result=(marks1+marks2+marks3)/3;
    }
    void output(){
        cout<<"Name: "<<name;
        cout<<"Roll Number: "<<rollNumber;
        cout<<"Average Marks: "<<result;
    }
};

int main()
{
    Student s;
    s.input();
    s.calculate();
    s.output();
}

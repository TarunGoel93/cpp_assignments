114. Problem Statement: Define a class Car with member variables for car make,
model, and year. Implement member functions to set and get these details.
Objectives: To learn how to define classes with member functions for setting and
getting data.
Functionalities: Set and get car details.

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

class Car{
    private:
    int year;
    string make , model;
    public:
    Car(): model(""),year(0),make(""){}
    void set(){
        cout<<"Enter car maker : ";
        cin>>make;
        cout<<"Enter car model : ";
        cin>>model;
        cout<<"Enter the year : ";
        cin>>year;
    }
    void get(){
        cout<<"Make: "<<make<<endl;
        cout<<"Model: "<<model<<endl;
        cout<<"Year: "<<year<<endl;
        }
};

int main()
{
    Car c;
    c.set();
    c.get();
}

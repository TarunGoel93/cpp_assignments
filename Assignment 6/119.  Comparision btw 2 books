119. Problem Statement: Define a class Book to represent a book with attributes like
title, author, and publication year. Implement member functions to compare two
books based on their publication years.
Objectives: To practice defining classes and implementing member functions for
comparison operations.
Functionalities: Compare publication years of two books.

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

class Book{
    private:
    string title,author;
    int year;
    public:

        cin>>title;
        cout<<"Enter the author of the book1: ";
        cin>>author;
        cout<<"Enter the year of the book1: ";

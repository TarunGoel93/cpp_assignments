32) Write a program to determine if the number is odd or even using while loop.

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int a,i=2,j=1;
    cout<<"Enter the number: ";
    cin>>a;
    
    cout<<"The even number between 2 and "<<a<<" are: "<<endl;
    while(i<=a){
       if(i%2==0){
           cout<<i<<" ";
       } 
       i++;
    }
    cout<<endl;
    cout<<"The odd number between 1 and "<<a<<" are: "<<endl;
    while(j<=a){
       if(j%2!=0){
            cout<<j<<" ";
        }  
        j++;
    }
return 0;
}
